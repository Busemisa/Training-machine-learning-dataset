# machine_learning_

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing features and outcomes of diabetes patients and applying various machine learning models for prediction.

The dataset is a CSV file comprising information about diabetes patients, including various features and their corresponding outcomes.

The project begins with a script that loads the dataset, performs data analysis, and conducts necessary preprocessing steps. Preprocessing includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing the data.

The first model builds and trains a classifier model using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) components. It evaluates the model's performance and provides visualization of the decision tree structure.

The second model trains a classifier model and evaluates its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

The third model trains a classifier model and evaluates its performance using similar metrics as used in the second model.

To use the project, install Anaconda or a similar Python distribution, install the required Python libraries, add the dataset to the project directory, and run the respective model script.
